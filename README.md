# dpghs (diceware password generator)

dpghs is simple utility that aims at generating secure, easy to remember passwords using diceware method.

## What is diceware?

Common problem with strong, secure passwords is that these are hard to remember. Diceware method () aims to solve the problem. This method is based on generating password containing couple of words (4 or more). It is easier to remember couple of words, especially those that could be somehow visualized, than do the same with random string of letters, special characters, digits etc. Good explanation of diceware has been depicted in one of the xkcd comic strips:

Diceware method is described in details by its author - Arnold G. Reinhold: http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html

## Usage


## Diceware lists

Dpg requires list of words to be used (diceware word list). At the moment the application has two lists built in: one containg words in English (default) and other list containing words in Polish (it has to be explicity specified). 

List of english words has been taken from FFI website: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases
List of Polish words has been created by me (https://github.com/MaciekTalaska/diceware-pl) - this work is based on the list created originally by Piotr (DrFugazi) Tarnowski.


[Mathias Gumz's repository](https://github.com/mgumz/diceware/tree/master/lists) contains diceware lists for different languages.
